# Background

Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence (Maldacena 1997)

- dynamic duality between large color gauge field $(3+1)D$ and gravity $(4+1)D$
- non-perturbative calculations of large coupling field theories

## Condensed Matter

AdS/CFT applied to condensed matter

- quantum Hall effect (Hartnoll 2007, Fujita 2009)
- Nernst effect (Hartnoll 2007)
- superconductivity (Hartnoll 2008, Domenech 2010)
- Aharonov-Bohm effect (Montull 2011)
- Lifshitz scaling (Kachru 2008)
- superfluidity and superconductivity (Hartnoll 2008, Hartnoll 2008)

## Hologrpahic Superfluids and Superconductors

Hartnoll et al. (Hartnoll 2008, Hartnoll 2008) found superconductivity in holography

- $U(1)$ scalar field condensation associated with superconductivity
- Superconductivity attained at a certain critical temperature

## Vortices

Canonical holographic superconductivity bulk theory
: $(3+1)$-dimensional Abelian-Higgs model serves

- Much attention is drawn to understanding the holographic dual of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs).
- Many papers found induced vorties on the dual boundary theory (Dias 2013, Albash 2009, Wittmer 2020, Wittmer 2021).

# Motivation

We analyze bulk $U(1)$ vortices and it's associated vacuum.

We wanted to know

- alternative approach to the breaking of the global $U(1)$ symmetry in the bulk
- find alternative ways to induced symmetry breaking on the boundary
- our model is different from past works because our U(1) theory is global

# Summary of Results

- Analyzed a bulk, global $U(1)$ $\phi^4$ + $(3+1)$D AAnti-de Sitter (AdS) GR
    - Hard Wall
    - Black Brane

$$S = - \int \sqrt{-g} \left(g^{\mu\nu}\left(\partial_{\mu}\right)\left(\partial_{\nu}\phi\right)^\star + \frac \lambda2 \left( |\phi|^2 + \frac{m^2}{\lambda} \right)^2 \right)$$

$$g = \frac {L^2}{z^2} \left( -f(z) dt^2 + \frac 1{f(z)}dz^2 + \delta_2 \right)$$


## Bulk Global U(1) Breaking Vacuum

**Found that a $U(1)$, bulk breaking vacuum was allowed if**

- $\displaystyle \lim_{z\to 0}\phi \sim z^0$
- $m^2 = -L^2 \lambda$

**This vacuum is**

- linearly stable against "sourceless" perturbations
- exhibits breaking of the $U(1)$ symmetry

## Single Bulk Vortex Solution

**Found single, static numerical solution**

- has the form $\phi = f(r, z) e^{i\theta}$
- constant $z$ slices are vorticies with a coupling $\propto \lambda/z^2$
    - or $R_{\text{vortex}} \propto z/\sqrt\lambda$
- is singular at the boundary

## Vortex String Approximation

**Studied vortex string approximation as pairs of vortices**

- between vortex-vortex (and vortex-antivortex) configurations
- radial profile must obey Neumann boundary conditions
- singular at the boundary
- found flat radial profiles for large separation distance
- found evidence for $R^{(3)}(0)$ is proportional to a localized scalar VEV

## Vortex String Approximation (Numerics)

**Numerically we found**

- Interaction energy vs seperation distance
- Found minimum temperature for given seperation distance
